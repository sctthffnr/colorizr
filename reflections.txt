My gem takes advantage of metaprogramming by creating methods from key/value pairs in a hash. This allows me to extend the
methods by creating a new key/value pair in the hash, instead of writing a completely new method.

It didn't take me very long to write the code for this assignment, but it did take me a while to understand the concepts.
The hardest part of the coding process turned out to be figuring out how to properly quote the string that I passed to
class_eval so that variable substitution worked properly.

I am pleased that I was able to use metaprogramming in this specially crafted sample project, and I am looking forward to seeing how
the rails framework uses metaprogramming.
